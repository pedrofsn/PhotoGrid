A beautiful sample using a ViewImageChange (custom view) like adapter of RecyclerView with GridLayoutManager. 
It's a good feature to social apps that has a kind of photo album.

The library it's just a custom view and sample it's the recyclerview and blah blah blah.

The sample module uses [Picasso 2 OkHttp 3 Downloader](https://github.com/JakeWharton/picasso2-okhttp3-downloader).
